# I successfully completed a time series analysis project in Power BI focused on sales analysis and forecasting. The project involved analyzing historical sales data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and key business insights, enabling data-driven decision-making. Using advanced Power BI features, I developed accurate sales forecasts to help businesses optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.
